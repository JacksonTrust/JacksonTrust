Hi everyone, my name's Jackson Trust, I'm a recent graduate from CU Boulder with a double degree in Applied Math (emphasis in CS) and Music.
I'm working for Modis as a Junior Software Engineer, and I'm hoping to learn a lot in the process!
I'm also looking to build a website using the tech stack I'll be using at my job for my younger brother's future business, should be a good time.
I'm going to be posting the code here each day that I do work on it, if anyone has suggestions, feel free to let me know at jatr5453@colorado.edu.
