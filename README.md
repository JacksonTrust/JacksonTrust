Hi everyone, my name's Jackson Trust, I'm a recent graduate from CU Boulder with a double degree in Applied Math (emphasis in CS) and Music.
I'll be working for Modis starting mid-July of 2021 as a Junior .NET/C# Engineer, and I'm hoping to learn a lot in the process!
I'm also looking to build a website using the tech stack I'll be using at my job for my younger brother's future business, should be a good time.
